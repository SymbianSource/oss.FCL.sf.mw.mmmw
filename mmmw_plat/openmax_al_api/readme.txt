The partial implementation of the Khronos OpenMAX AL API in this distribution has implemented the following features:

* Audio recording

As such, it is NOT a *conformant* OpenMAX AL implementation, as defined by Khronos. That is, it has NOT passed the OpenMAX AL conformance tests. It is to be noted however, that Nokia has signed the Adopter's Agreement and paid the requisite adopter fees for OpenMAX AL v1.0. It is our intention to apply for conformance once we have a complete OpenMAX AL implementation in either the Media Player or Media Player/Recorder profiles.

For now, Nokia has gone ahead with distribution of this partial implementation to facilitate use of this implementation by Symbian Foundation members for evaluation/prototyping purposes. Nokia will be adding to this partial implementation in the coming months, as more and more parts of OpenMAX AL are implemented. Our objective is to eventually have a fully conformant implementation of OpenMAX AL as part of the Symbian Foundation code base.
