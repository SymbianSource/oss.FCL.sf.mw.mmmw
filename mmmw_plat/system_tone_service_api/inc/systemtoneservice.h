 *  the Play Alarm completes.  The same observer can be used for different
 *  PlayAlarm calls, even ones that are playing at the same time.

     * which case the callback is guaranteed not to be called.
     * 
     * Implementations of this interface cannot make any assumptions about
     * which thread this method is called on, it may or may not be the same
     * thread from which the PlayAlarm was called.  It is up to the clients
     * to provide what ever mutual exclusion protection that is needed for

     * In some cases and especially on SMP systems there is a chance that
     * this method may be called before the PlayAlarm method returns.  It is
     * up to the client to correctly handle this potential race condition.
     * 
     * Clients cannot assume properties about the thread that the callback
     * is running on, for instance the thread may or may not have Active
     * Scheduler.
     * 
     * It is strongly recommended that clients do as little as possible
     * processing in this method and to complete this method as quickly as
     * possible.

 * The methods of this class are guaranteed to be thread safe and may be
 * used from any thread within the same process.  An instance of this class
 * may not be shared between processes, even if the processes share memory.
