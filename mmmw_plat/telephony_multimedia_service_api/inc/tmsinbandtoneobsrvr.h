 * TMSInbandToneObserver class
 *
 * This class provides callback mechanism for TMSInbandTone listeners.
 *
 * Client class that wants to receive events from TMS must inherit from
 * TMSInbandToneObserver class and register itself with the TMSInbandTone object.
 *
 * Functions declared in this class are called upon TMS events.
 *
 * The client must not do any blocking, or perform any CPU-intensive operations
 * in the callback methods. It is recommended that the client saves event data,
 * returns from this function immediately and if necessary, responds to
 * the event in asynchronous way.
